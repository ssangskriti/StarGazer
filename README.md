# StarGazer

This repository is a part of an android application which was my JAVA project. The application was  meant to be a VR app which shows some constellations of the night sky, just their shapes, names and a few stars. A video also is included with the stars inside the VR app. 

The andoird portion is not uploaded here. This part can only be visible while integrated with the VR part.
